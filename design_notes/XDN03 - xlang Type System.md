- Status: draft

## Abstract

This design note describes the xlang's [type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system).
The type system is designed to interoperate with a variety of object-oriented programming
languages in a natural and familiar way.

## Overview

The xlang type system is not designed to used directly. Rather, it is designed to be projected into
the existing type systems of popular object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, Java and Python.
